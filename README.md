The TI99/4A was a great little computer.  
I fixed the keyboard - broken solder joints below the top row of keys. 
So far I have added 
Finagrom 99 - sd cartridge emulator 
32K memory upgrade + 3d printed case
dual joystick adaptor  + 3d printed case 
speech synthesizer - with 5V pass through to the 32kb mem. 

A few years ago I got hold of a Nicolette oscilloscope and 5.25" disk drive.   I was very excited, but on powering it on a cloud of white smoke escaped and I decided that perhaps oscilloscope maintenance was not for me.  also there was a mouses nest inside.  
The Oscilloscope was basically a Ti 9995 based computer,  CPU and lots of good IC's.  
So now what to do with a TMS9995 CPU ?  
I plan to build a breadboard 9995 computer according to plans by Stuart Conner
Then having proven the chips work I plan to move onto a Mini Cortex (also Stuart Conner).
if I can get that working then peraps I go for a KiCad replication of the original Cortex design and get some PCB's made ... ah dreams.  9 feb 2024
