The TI99/4A was a great little computer.  
I fixed the keyboard - broken solder joints below the top row of keys. 
So far I have added 
Finagrom 99 - sd cartridge emulator 
32K memory upgrade + 3d printed case
dual joystick adaptor  + 3d printed case 
speech synthesizer - with 5V pass through to the 32kb mem.
